      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Hi, I’m Marie. I’m new to graphic and web design but I’m passionate at what I do. I design with a purpose in mind and that purpose will always be how to help your business. If you’re a small business owner who can’t afford a seasoned designer, I can help you. Tell about me about your problems and I can design solutions and get results.</p>
      <p>Check out my projects and let me know if you like what you see.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>My target audience is small business owners who are in need of reaching out to more customers through a website or other graphic design needs.
      These entrepreneurs do not have the capacity to hire highly experienced designers.
      They are looking for an affordable designer, willing to take a chance on a less experienced designer 
      but not compromise on quality and strong design.</p>

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Marie.</p>
      <p>I fell in love with graphic design ever since I watched a documentary on how Hallmark made their greeting cards.
        The design process involved really captivated me. I told myself then, "I want to do that." Life took me on a different
        path but 23 years later I'm trying to live my first passion. I'm currently studying Web Design and Development at
        Brigham Young University Idaho. I learn and refine my skills by working on school projects and other personal
        projects.</p>
      <p>I was born and raise in the Philippines but now lives in Utah with my husband and 4 little humans.
        I enjoy doing anything my children loves to do: playing Minecraft, going to pars, even singing Baby Shark
        for the hundredth time.</p>
      <p>My Design Philosophy <br> I take the design process seriously. I love seeing one small idea turn into something amazing.
      Of course, there are many steps involved in growing a small seed of idea into something fruitful. There's research, ideation,
    sketching, collaboration, feedback, testing, and of course, more feedback.</p>
