            <h1>ABOUT</h1>
            <p>I fell in love with graphic design since I watched a documentary on how Hallmark made their greeting cards.
                The design process involved really captivated me. I told myself then, "I want to do that." 
                Life took me on a different path but 23 years later I'm trying to live my first passion. 
                I'm currently studying Web Design and Development at Brigham Young University Idaho. 
                I learn and refine my skills by working on school projects and other personal projects.
            </p>
            <p>I was born and raised in the Philippines but now lives in Utah with my husband and 4 little humans.
                I enjoy doing anything my children loves to do: playing Minecraft, going to parks, even singing
                Baby Shark for the hundredth time.

                <h2>My Design Philosophy</h2>
                <p>I take the design process seriously. I love seeing one small idea turn into something amazing.
                    Of course, there are many steps involved in growing a small seed of idea into something fruitful.
                    There's research, ideation, sketching, collaboration, feedback, testing, and of course, more feedback.
